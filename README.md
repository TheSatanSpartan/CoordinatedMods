# CoordinatedMods
Project Draft aiming to organize volunteers in providing integrations between highly desirable mods synergies 
or boost where possible mods feature releases with temporary forks. Maybe will result in some community maintained addon,
but until a proper direction is set, the scope will be technical analysis, documentation and feasibility studies 
in order to simplify onboarding and progress of modders and random talented programmers. 

### Current scope:

1. explore and determine the structures and patters 
2. produce meaningfull information on the inner workings
3. speculate the direction to bidirectionally improve mod pairs
4. brownfield approach, describe feature flag and configurability 
5. As soon a pattern emerge describe the possible standard that a \*number\* of mods can adopt.
Example: Epic Fight rendering model sophistication make it a good candidate for a standard to share across mods that work on player/mob models
